title: SQL w/ Python Connector Project
---

This project takes a look at stock prices from Yahoo! finance, and loads it into
an mySQL database with the Python connector. It's intent is to explore basic commands
in SQL (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY) while also using intermediate commands (JOINS,
FUNCTIONS, STORED PROCEDURES).

I am attending the University of Colorado Boulder in 2019 to pursue my Masters Degree in Business Analytics with a concentration in Security Analytics. My anticipated graduation will be in May of 2020. 

I am passionate about using data and visualization tools to help inform key decisions amongst organizations. Primarily, I have experience with mySQL, Python, and R. I understand basic to intermediate Linear and Logistic Regression. I am currently in the process of developing a machine learning skill set.

I have had several years of experience in leading, organizing, communicating, and making key decisions during my time at Louisiana State University. I also enjoy running, traveling and experiencing new things, watching and playing sports, and learning.

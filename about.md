## **Academic background**
I am an Industrial Engineer, graduated on 2020 at the [Universidad Pontificia de Comillas (ICAI)](https://www.comillas.edu/en/icai) and currently studying a [Master in Industrial Engineering](https://www.comillas.edu/en/masters/official-master-degree-in-industrial-engineering) at [Comillas (ICAI)](https://www.comillas.edu/en/icai) which I expect to complete by June 2022.
 <br> 

### **Why did I specialize on electrical engineering?**
During the formation at the Comillas University there are three options to choose as an engineering specialty: mechanical, electrical and electronic.
I always felt that it were the subjects related to electrical engineering that I enjoyed the most. Also, the ICAI school of engineering has a recognized tradition for producing great engineers for the electric sector (being Iberdrola's CEO, [Sánchez Galán](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacio_Gal%C3%A1n), the most well-known right now).
 <br> 
As if these reasons weren't powerful enough to focus on the electric specialty of the degree, I've always believed that the transition to a new energetic model with a deeper integration of renewable sources and, especially, the arrival of the electric car to the homes of millions of people in the near future will definitely require a vast amount of electrical engineers. So the availability of job offers also seemed very appealing.
